# Working on Attn Lens

Attn Lens captures part of the live screen, marks it up in place, and sends it to
an attn agent session through the `attn` CLI. It is a fork of Glance; the rest of
this file describes Glance's rules, which still apply to the code that remains.

## Lens entry points

Lens is being rebuilt on Rune. `s-24857n` in the attn garden holds the plan. Glance's
GPUI code is at `git show a64f4fb:src/...`, the reference for behavior being ported.
This file's Glance rules still apply to the code that remains.

- `src/app.rs`: the Rune app and its windows. A Dock app (⌘Q quits, a Dock click
  opens the editor). When `rune::tooling::is_headless()` is true, overlays are hosted
  as ordinary windows; that is the only branch on the platform.
- `src/platform_port.rs`: `PlatformPort`, everything the UI asks of the machine.
  `platform_port/mac.rs` is real; `platform_port/fake.rs` is driven by script marks.
  The draw key is one constant in `mac.rs`.
- `src/editor/`: the editor window. Every toolbar, menu, key and gesture reaches
  `Editor::dispatch` in `dispatch.rs`. `gesture.rs` is the pointer on the canvas;
  `preview.rs` renders the raster off the UI thread; `live.rs` paints marks not yet
  in it. `stage.rs` renders the backdrop behind the image, and whole frames while
  the Animation panel plays, on the port's `Lane` (one thread on the Mac, so Metal
  keeps its thread-local state); `export.rs` runs GIF and MP4 export. In scripts,
  MP4 goes through the stand-in encoder `tests/video-encoder`. `tests/editor.rs` runs `headless/editor/*.json`, one script per row of
  `TOOL_OPTIONS.md` and the tables in `docs/usage.md`; each holds its assertions.
- `src/lens/mod.rs`: `Lens`, the state every window and the socket read. Each change
  wakes the windows, because a Rune window does not redraw from another's change.
- `src/lens/session.rs`: Capture, Still, Segment, HostTime.
- `src/lens/select.rs`, `ink.rs`, `bar.rs`: the area picker, the ink layer and the bar.
  `app.rs` hosts the picker, the ink layer and the four corner handles as `Surface`s.
  The ink layer takes the pointer only while the draw key is held; the handles are
  small windows of their own, below the menu bar, that hold still during a resize.
- `src/lens/attn.rs`: the only contract with attn: `attn send sessions`, `attn
  send pair` and `attn send <session>` JSON, plus the Keychain token. Its tests
  use a stand-in `attn`; attn's `cmd/attn/send_stack_test.go` pins the real JSON.
- `src/lens/capture.rs`: stills through Hex's capture-core (ScreenCaptureKit).
- `src/lens/automation.rs`: the development socket. Launch with `--automation`, then
  `AttnLens lens '{"cmd":"state"}'`; the module's header lists the requests.
- `tools/driver/driver.swift`: posts synthetic keys and drags. Run it in the VM below;
  on a real Mac only in a window agreed with the user. It stops if real input arrives.
- `scripts/lens-vm.sh`: a macOS VM (Tart) for driven checks, so no key reaches this Mac.
  `setup` once, then `push` to install this checkout signed ad hoc, `driver SCRIPT` to run
  a driver script in the VM's GUI session, `check OUT` to run `scripts/lens-mac-check.sh`
  and `live OUT` to run `scripts/lens-live.sh`, both against the stand-in `tools/vm/attn`,
  and `stop` when done: it holds 8 GB. `tools/vm/`
  grants the VM's permissions without a click. Nothing of this Mac's goes in: no shared
  folders, Keychain, tokens or signing identity. Speed budgets and the feel of drawing
  stay on the real Mac; VM numbers do not count for them.
- `headless/`: Rune scripts, asserted by `tests/headless.rs`. Assert on trees, read with
  `--window KEY --tree out.json --at mark:NAME`, not only on snapshots.
- `src/permission_guide.rs`, `native/permission_guide.m`: from Hex (MIT).
- Sign dev bundles with a stable identity (`GLANCE_CODESIGN_IDENTITY`): an
  ad-hoc rebuild silently invalidates the Screen Recording grant.
- `scripts/install.sh` builds this checkout, replaces
  `~/Applications/Attn Lens.app`, quits the running copy and opens the new one.
  It signs with this Mac's Apple Development identity unless
  `GLANCE_CODESIGN_IDENTITY` names another, and refuses ad-hoc. It replaces the
  user's installed app, so run it only when asked to install.

# Glance

Glance was a native macOS screenshot editor. Its image model remains: one document,
exported to PNG, GIF and MP4. Use Cargo and the existing Rust tooling; do not add a
JavaScript toolchain.

## Entry points and architecture

- `src/document.rs` and `document/actions.rs`: image model, validated edits, undo.
- `src/arrow.rs`, `backdrop.rs`, `effects.rs`, `style.rs`, `selection.rs`,
  `navigation.rs`: mark geometry and raster painting, free of any UI toolkit.
- `src/animation.rs`, `src/motion_shader.rs`, `src/shaders/motion.metal`: backdrops
  and entrance animation for export.
- `src/platform.rs`: dialogs, fonts, and clipboard; Linux lives in `src/platform/linux.rs`.
- `native/`: AVFoundation/FFmpeg helpers. `scripts/bundle.sh`: macOS packaging.

See `docs/usage.md` for the editor's behavior.
`PLAN.md` is historical; do not use its early scope as the current feature list.

## Working rules

- Keep rendering/export work off the UI thread. Preserve undo and editable
  annotations; guard asynchronous results with operation/revision checks.
- Dispatch typed actions from new UI or automation triggers. Do not fabricate
  keyboard events to invoke commands.
- Keep local editing offline. Do not upload captures, expose the automation
  bridge, or change certificate trust as an incidental validation step.
- Use synthetic samples for docs and tests. Preserve third-party licenses and
  provenance. Keep signing material and credentials outside Git.
- Keep PRs focused and update usage docs when behavior or shortcuts change.

## File and process safety

- Use private, randomized temporary directories for captures and helper outputs.
  Keep export scratch files beside the destination for atomic rename. Never use
  predictable PID/counter paths or truncate an unreserved temporary file.
- Preserve the exact filename confirmed by a save dialog. An appended extension
  must not silently replace an existing file or symlink. Automation exports create new
  destinations and must reject existing files.
- Treat automation media inputs as local files: reject URLs and special files,
  bound actual reads, and disable network protocols in media helpers. Pass
  arguments directly to processes; never interpolate them into shell scripts.
- Check dependency advisories during security reviews. Distinguish affected
  versions from reachable vulnerable APIs; record evidence and upstream limits.

## Validation

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
```

For native-helper or packaging changes, build with `./scripts/bundle.sh debug`.
For CI/isolated packaging checks, set `GLANCE_CODESIGN_IDENTITY=-` to avoid
certificate trust setup. Ad-hoc bundles have unstable capture permissions;
do not replace a user's installed app with one as part of validation.

Check `QA.md` for manual desktop verification.
Ignored tests are opt-in and may write media, use native helpers, benchmark, or
upload to production; read the test before explicitly running it.

## Changelog and releases

Maintain top-level `CHANGELOG.md` for user-visible changes. Add entries to the
existing `Added`, `Changed`, or `Fixed` subsection of `Unreleased`; do not create
duplicate headings. Omit internal-only refactors unless behavior changes.

On release, move the relevant entries into a dated version section, leave that
released section immutable, and start a fresh `Unreleased` section. Align Cargo
and bundle versions. Use the released section as the GitHub release body and
verify any generated notes. Use `gh release create/edit --notes-file` for
multiline notes. Publishing releases or changing visibility requires a user
request; preparing the repository does not make it public.

Commit titles use Conventional Commits: `<type>[scope]: <description>`.
